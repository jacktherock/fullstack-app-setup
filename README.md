# Fullstack App Setup

**Fullstack App Setup** is a CLI tool that automates the creation of a full-stack project with a React (client) and a Node.js + TypeScript (server) setup. It simplifies the initial setup of a full-stack application by scaffolding both the client and server directories with necessary dependencies, folder structures, and configuration files.

## Features

- Automatically creates a full-stack project
- Sets up a React client with TypeScript
- Configures a Node.js server with TypeScript
- Includes basic configurations like `tsconfig.json`, `.env` files, and folder structure
- Pre-installed commonly used dependencies (e.g., Express, Mongoose, Redux, Axios)

## Installation

To install the package globally:

```bash
npm install -g fullstack-app-setup
