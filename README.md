# Fullstack App Setup

**Fullstack App Setup** is a CLI tool designed to automate the creation of a full-stack project with a React (client) and a Node.js + TypeScript (server) setup. It simplifies the initial setup of a full-stack application by scaffolding both the client and server directories with necessary dependencies, folder structures, and configuration files.

## Features

- **Automated Project Creation**: Quickly set up a full-stack project with just one command.
- **React Client Setup**: Includes TypeScript and essential configurations for the React client.
- **Node.js Server Setup**: Configured with TypeScript and includes commonly used packages.
- **Pre-installed Dependencies**: Comes with commonly used libraries like Express, Mongoose, Redux, and Axios.
- **Basic Configuration Files**: Automatically sets up `tsconfig.json`, `.env`, and folder structures for both client and server.

## Installation

To install the `fullstack-app-setup` package globally, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g fullstack-app-setup
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can create a new full-stack project by using the command:

```bash
create-fullstack-app <folder-name>
```

Replace `<folder-name>` with the desired name for your project directory. This command will create a new folder with the specified name and set up both the React client and Node.js server within it.

## Project Structure

The tool sets up the following folder structure:

```
<folder-name>
├── client
│   ├── public
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── assets
│   │   ├── components
